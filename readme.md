# APOD interface built with astro uxds

üõ∞Ô∏è Check out the [website](https://joel-madrigal.github.io/apod-astroux/)

Todo:

- display [upcoming launches](https://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/) in a little widget under the apod
- a link to the [us news and rankings for college astronomy programs](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/space-science)
- Astronaut Profiles & Mission History (database of astronauts, their missions, and notable achievements)
- something about [cubesats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat)
- could make [youtube video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzNMe3vyEOlMSaW6Z3C9wQ) of the astro uxds library for education and exposure
- an About Us page of joel and vivek
- keep using astro uxds components to create a more nicer UI experienc

Done:

- fetch apod picture and show it
- definitely add a link to the [spacecrew.com job board](https://spacecrew.com/). bonus points make it its own widget?
- "where is the international space station" widget, [like this](https://www.astroviewer.net/iss/en/)

NOTE:
- fetching upcoming launch data has proven to be tricky since there are little free sources that let you scrape their html/fetch an API.
